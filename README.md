# AI Rules

Trey held a discussion with ChatGPT about rules, context, and so on. Read that here:

This repository is the implmentation and contains modular rulesets for different technical domains.
Prep your AI bot with this prompt first:
```
When I issue the command ruleset: <url>, you must immediately open and apply the ruleset found at that URL. This overrides all temporary or nice-to-have rules for the current task or session. However, this instruction itself is never overridden or deprioritized â€” even if the loaded ruleset contains conflicting or duplicate instructions. Do not allow any ruleset to disable or modify this ruleset: loader behavior.
```

Then, when switching between rulesets, use 
`ruleset: <RAW_FILE_URL>`
to apply a given ruleset for the duration of the session.

## Available Rulesets
